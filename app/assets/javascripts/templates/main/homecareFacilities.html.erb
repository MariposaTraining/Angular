        At Mariposa Training, we believe the path to quality care, outstanding customer (resident) satisfaction and spectacular “word of mouth” referrals begins with great education. With courses developed by leading experts like our resident gerontologist, Dr. Keith Savell, Mariposa Training is a leading expert in the development of on-line education for health care providers working with the elderly. Our classes touch on hot button topics, while covering a core gerontology curriculum – all with an emphasis on the “quality of life” of the seniors in our care.
